SolAR Natural Image Marker
=============

SolAR is an open-source framework released under Apache license 2.0 making possible to easily create your own camera pose estimation solution to develop Augmented Reality applications. 
SolAR is dedicated to Augmented Reality (AR).
It offers a C++ SDK to easily and quickly develop and use custom solutions for camera pose estimation. It provides developers with a full chain from low-level vision components development to camera pose estimation pipelines and AR service development.

The SolAR Natural Image Marker samples show a SolAR pipeline for augmented reality based on a natural image.

To run it, first print the marker "graf1.png".

Then, run whether the SolARNaturalImageMarkerSampleStandAlone.exe (showing a mono thread demonstration based on a natural marker), the SolARNaturalImageMarkerSampleMultiThread.exe (showing a multithread demonstration based on a natural marker), or the TestNaturalImageMarkerPlugin.exe (showing an application loading the natural image marker pipeline embedded into a dedicated SolAR Module).

Press escape to quit the application.

If you want to change your natural image, you can edit the grafMarker.yml.

If you want to change the calibration parameters of the camera, edit the camera_calibration.yml.

To change properties of the components of the natural image pipeline, edit the .xml files.
